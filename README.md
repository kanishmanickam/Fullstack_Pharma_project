## Core Features and Owner Benefits

### 1. Smart Purchase Auto-Drafts (No More Stockouts or Dead Stock)
* **The Technology**: Powered by local **TensorFlow.js (LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks)** and Holt-Winters smoothing.
* **How it helps you**: The system automatically analyzes your last 90 days of sales to predict exactly how much of each medicine you will need in the coming weeks. It then **automatically drafts purchase orders** for your suppliers, taking the guesswork out of ordering, preventing empty shelves, and saving you from tying up cash in unsold "dead stock."

### 2. Hands-Free Bilingual Voice Assistant (Instant Stock Answers)
* **The Technology**: Powered by a secure backend integration with **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**.
* **How it helps you**: When your hands are full assisting customers or counting inventory, you and your staff can simply **speak to the system** in English or Tamil. Ask questions like *"Where is Paracetamol?"* or *"What is expiring soon?"*, and the chatbot will instantly retrieve the exact batch, current stock level, and rack location for you.

### 3. High-Accessibility Tamil Speech (Works on Any Device)
* **The Technology**: Custom Tamil Unicode-to-English phonetic character mapping engine.
* **How it helps you**: You don’t need to buy expensive, high-end computers for your shop. Our custom phonetic mapping engine ensures the Tamil voice assistant works smoothly and speaks clearly on **any device** (smartphones, cheap tablets, or old PCs) - even if the device does not natively support Tamil system voices.

### 4. FEFO-Driven Batch Tracking (Drastically Reduce Expired Waste)
* **The Technology**: Multi-batch ledger with automatic **First-Expired, First-Out (FEFO)** sorting.
* **How it helps you**: Stop losing money to expired medicines. The system tracks products by batch number, specific shelf/rack location, and expiry date. When generating a bill, **it automatically suggests stock from the batch closest to expiry first**, making sure you sell older inventory before it goes to waste.

### 5. Secure Prescription & Order Workflow (Expand Your Shop Online)
* **The Technology**: Secure image upload (via Multer), dynamic status pipelines, and automated Twilio WhatsApp / Nodemailer email notifications.
* **How it helps you**: Modernize your pharmacy by letting customers securely upload photos of their prescriptions online. You can quickly review, approve, or reject uploads from a clean dashboard. Once approved, the system **automatically alerts the customer via WhatsApp and email**, keeping them informed and driving higher customer satisfaction.
